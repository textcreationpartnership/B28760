            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS Humbly offered to Consideration of the PARLIAMENT,</hi> For laying a further Duty upon <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> and other Foreign <hi>SALT,</hi> (except <hi>Scotch Salt,</hi> and what is consumed upon the Fishery of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) towards the support and encouragement of the Manufacture of <hi>SALT</hi> in this Nation.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THat before <hi>Salt-Pans</hi> were erected in several parts in <hi>England;</hi> The French and other Foreign Nations, did at their pleasure exact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Rates upon the English Nation: <hi>Viz.</hi> to 8 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> and 12 <hi>s. per</hi> Bushel, and at other times prohibited the same to come for <hi>England,</hi> especially in time of War.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Salt-Works</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> if encouraged, are sufficient to supply the whole Kingdom at moderate Rates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it hath been the Wisdom of this present Parliament, in order to the giving some encouragement to the said <hi>English Manufacture,</hi> to lay a Duty of 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Wey on <hi>Scotch Salt</hi> (the Manufacture of His Majesties Subjects) when <hi>French Salt</hi> payes but 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Wey to this time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the present decaying condition of the <hi>Salt-Works</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is such, That unless a higher Duty be imposed upon French, Spanish, and other Foreign <hi>Salt,</hi> the said Manufacture will in a short time be ruined, and many thousands of Families, who subsist thereby, destroyed and undone.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the French King having by his continued Edicts, excluded the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of all <hi>English Salt</hi> into his Kingdom, and the <hi>Scots</hi> having for the advantage of their own Manufacture of <hi>Salt,</hi> lately imposed an high Duty on <hi>French,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Salt,</hi> of the nature of a Prohibition, it is humbly conceived, it may be thought but reasonable for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to lay on such a Duty on Foreign <hi>Salt</hi> also, as may support and encourage that Manufacture in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That what hath hitherto Obstructed the doing of what is now desired, hath been the want of an expedient, to preserve the Foreign <hi>Salt,</hi> which shall from time to time be imploied in the English Fishery from such Duties; which is now humbly proposed may be particularly provided for.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It is humbly proposed, That the Duty on such Foreign <hi>Salt,</hi> may not longer be continued, then while English made <hi>Salt</hi> is sold at such Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Prices, as the Parliament in their Great Wisdom shall think fit to limit and appoint.</p>
